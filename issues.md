## This is a list of current CS2 issues that we'd like Valve to fix:
- There is currently no way to edit the properties of existing entities: The `AddOutput` hammer output does not support keyvalues, and there is no vscript API to do the same (like `__KeyValueFromInt` in source1).
- Entities don't remove their allocated `EntityNames` string when killed, even when the entity is part of a template with name fixup enabled. This can cause an overflow after many rounds on an entity-heavy map.
- Players get stuck on moving objects if they touch them from the sides (i.e. standing on top of them is fine).
- Surf ramps clip the player at the top and bottom, as if there's a protruding edge somehow, this was not an issue in HL:A.
- The `player_chat` game event does not fire when players send chat messages.
- The `IgniteLifetime` hammer input (which was used to burn players) no longer works when fired via vscript, and it seemingly crashes the client if fired using `ent_fire`.
- Both the `game_text` entity and `UTIL_MessageText` in the vscript API do not work, possibly due to the removal of vgui elements.
- `UserIDToControllerHScript` has an off-by-one error (needing to add 1 to the input ID) and occasionally does not work at all.
- The `game_ui`, `player_speedmod`, and `game_money` entities are missing with seemingly no equivalent available as hammer entities or in the vscript API.
- HUD health does not properly show more than 3 digits.
- HTML formatting is broken in center hud message when displayed using `ScriptPrintMessageCenter`.
- Missing monitor shader for `info_offscreen_panorama_texture`, and missing `info_offscreen_movie_texture` entity.
