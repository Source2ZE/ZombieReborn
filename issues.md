This is a list of current CS2 issues that we'd like Valve to fix
- The ability to edit entity keyvalues, both through a hammer output akin to AddOutput in source 1 and vscript API
- Players get stuck on moving objects if they touch them from the sides (i.e. standing on top of them is fine)
- The entities game_ui, player_speedmod, and player_weaponstrip
- Hud health doesn't support more than 3 digits
- game_text/UTIL_MessageText does not work, possibly due to the removal of vgui elements
- HTML formatting is broken in ScriptPrintMessageCenter
- Surf ramps clip the player at the top and bottom, as if there's a protruding edge somehow, this was not an issue in HL:A
- The player_chat game event does not fire
- UserIDToControllerHScript has an off-by-one error and occasionally does not work at all
- Missing monitor shader for info_offscreen_panorama_texture, and missing info_offscreen_movie_texture entity
