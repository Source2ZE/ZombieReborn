# ZombieReborn

Zombie:Reborn is a plugin designed for running Zombie Escape on Counter-Strike 2. However it can also be used for other zombie gamemodes like Zombie Mod.

We are currently maintaining/supporting a ZR implementation within [CS2Fixes](https://github.com/Source2ZE/CS2Fixes). Eventually, this repository will be reused for a standalone ZR plugin in CounterStrikeSharp or Source2Mod.

[Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/QsSGf9ZEVs) for development discussion and to keep up to date!

## Installation

- Follow [CS2Fixes install instructions](https://github.com/Source2ZE/CS2Fixes?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
- Ensure `zr_enable 1` is set in `cfg/cs2fixes/cs2fixes.cfg`
- Navigate to `/game/csgo/addons/cs2fixes/configs/zr` and rename the config files by removing `.example`, then configure them as desired
